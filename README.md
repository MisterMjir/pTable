A console Periodic Table tool

# Install
1. Go to whatever release you want (I suggest latest)
2. Install the correct executable for your system
3. If your system isn't there then you will have to build it yourself, sorry :(

## Fine Print
- Currently doesn't have much functionality... (more features are planned!)
